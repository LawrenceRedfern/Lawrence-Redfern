										<h1>My Project Idea</h1>

										<h2>Overview</h2>
									</header>

									<article>
									<p>My ideas of a project would be starting to build my own smart home system that links into other smart home systems like Amazon Echo, Phillips HUE, Google Smart Home and others. I would start by building a device that I believe no other company has and that would be a smart mirror linked into a smart beside clock. The mirror would use a screen fit to the size of the mirror that would display weather, time, current music playing, task’s for the day, total sleep time (linked into smart watches or other equipment to make that possible) and could possibly order food using uber eats or even start your other smart home items that you generally use in the morning.

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
								  </header>
									<article>
									<p>My motivation behind this project was seeing a youtuber do a smart mirror but not to the extent I’m planning on making mine. His was a simple smart mirror that used a Raspberry Pi to display information but as far as I can recall it wasn’t able to connect to other smart home systems other then Amazon Echo. I seen the video and had the idea of making my own smart home mirror but making it compatible with a lot of other smart home items and then making a product out of it if everything went well. I was not surprised when I discovered how difficult this would be but that inspired me even more as I love a challenge.

									<h2>Outcome</h2>
								  </header>
									<article>
									<p>I feel as though if this project was successful and the word about it got out there then other smart home companies could come out with similar products and create another highly useful smart home system and could make companies look at other household devices that could be automated for the ease of end users life and make life simpler if you could check valuable information while simultaneously getting ready for work or school so you wouldn’t waste time using your phone for this information. I t could also be used in a work place as a message board in the staff rooms with live updates from manager’s, ect.
